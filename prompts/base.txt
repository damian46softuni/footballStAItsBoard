I want to develop Footbal matches statistics and predictions application.
It should display todays footbal maches, view deteail information abot footbal match with statistics and prediction.
It shoud have an intuitive design and suport filtration, sorting, diferent views, ... 

The application will be called "footballStAItsBoard" (the casing matters)

Tech stack:
- For the backend: Express.js + MongoDB
- For the forntend: React + Redux + matirial UI
- There will be no authentication 
- Let's use TypeScript for backend and forntend
Keep in mind that the current version on the server is v22.11.0 for node, and 10.9.0 for npm.
- Use latest stable versions for all necessary package
- MongoDB will be install locally at later point


I need you to help me  prepare the initial project setup, so I can later develop all needed functionality one by one.

For information about football matches, such as a list of matches and details about football matches, we will get them from an external API, after which we will process the data in our backend, after which our backend will serve them to our frontend app.
The authorization to the external API will be made via a token, which we should configure in a dotenv file.

Let for now make initial setup of application, all needed functionality one by one later

* PLAN - Clooud Opus 4.6
====================================================================================================================
"Start Implementation". At the end validate that the both back- and fornt-end start successfuly nd listens to the specifed ports 
* PLAN - Clooud Opus 4.6

====================================================================================================================

# Terminal 1
cd backend && npm run dev

# Terminal 2
cd frontend && npm start

====================================================================================================================


I want to set up "docker-compose" file with single container for the MongoDB database. Use volumes to store data so if the container is removed and then recreated, i will not lose anything.
* AGENT claude sonnet 4.6

docker compose up -d

====================================================================================================================


I want you to create an API call in the backend that return all available matches.
The API Response should have the needed information + an array of match objects.
Each match object should have the following fields:

{
    "id": id of the mache (number),
    "utcDate": utc Date,
    "homeTeam": {
        "id": id of the tean (number),
        "name": team name (string),
        "shortName": team short name (string),
        "crest": logo of the team (string),
    },
    "awayTeam": {
        "id": id of the tean (number),
        "name": team name (string),
        "shortName": team short name (string),
        "crest": logo of the team (string),
    },
     "area": {
        "id": id of area (number),
        "name": name of area (string),
        "code": cod of area (string),
        "flag": area flag (string)
    },
    "competition": {
        "id": id of competition string (string),
        "name": name of competition (string),
        "code": code of competition (string),
        "emblem": emblem of competition (string)
    },
}


The necessary information for the response of our new API will have to be taken from an external API:
url: https://api.football-data.org/v4/matches
To access the external API, the application must authenticate itself using the following header in the request:
X-Auth-Token=EXTERNAL_API_TOKEN
where the value of EXTERNAL_API_TOKEN should be taken from dotenv

Documentation for the external API can be found here: https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart

Let's now display the new backend API endpoint for listing all matches on the frontend.
Let's display all matches on the frontend homepage of the project using /api/matches

We want a nice clean visualization, presenting all football matches, with the date and time of their start, as well as the names of the country and the championships with their flags and icons, the names of the teams and their emblems.

* Implementation GPT-5.3-Codex
====================================================================================================================

Can we make the header static and always sit at the top of the page?
* AGENT GPT-5.3-Codex

====================================================================================================================
if possible, we could slightly enlarge the icons and names of the championships and the country
